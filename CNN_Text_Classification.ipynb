Specifically, words that appear in similar contexts should point in roughly the same direction. To measure whether two vectors are colinear, we can use [**cosine similarity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), which computes the dot product of two vectors. This dot product is largest when the angle between two vectors is 0 (cos(0) = 1) and cosine is at a maximum, so cosine similarity is larger for aligned vectors.\n",
